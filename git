Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) used for tracking changes in source code and collaborating with other developers.
It allows multiple people to work on the same project efficiently and keeps a history of changes, making it easy to review, revert, and manage code 
development over time.
Git cycle:
1.Intialize a folder to git using (git init file_name).
2.Set up a staging area for the file where we can preapre and organize changes for our file.(git add file_name).
can also use (git add.) to add all files to the staging area.
3.Then last step is to commit when ever we will write (git commit) all the files created will be commited to git.(git commit -m "a message")
(git log) -> shows all the directories or folders that are commited along with their owner and the message.
